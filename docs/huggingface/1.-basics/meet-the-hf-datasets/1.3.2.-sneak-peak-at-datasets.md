> Data is the start of it all: it defines everything you do in your project. Hugging Face is amazing place as has lot of datasets that we can use to jump start building great things AI.



> #### Problem 2
>
> **I found my data, but how can I work with it using Hugging Face tools?**
>
> What you most commonly want to do with the data is to load it, explore and prep (or transform) your data for further use = put it in the model!&#x20;

Let's have a closer look at datasets at Hugging Face and see how we can use data workflow with the `datasets` library.

We can find datasets at this special Datasets section at Hugging Face [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhuggingface.co%2Fdatasets) and we also have support for our data workflow in the datasets library . So you see we have both - data repos and tools to work with data.

When I am not sure how to do something related to data at Hugging Face, I always go and check docs [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/index)

I really like this library: it makes working with data simplifies how to access and work with myriads of datasets for an ML/AI project.
