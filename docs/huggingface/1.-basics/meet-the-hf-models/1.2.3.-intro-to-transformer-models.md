# 1.2.3. Intro to transformer models



**Overview**

This session provides a brief and practical introduction to transformer models using the Hugging Face Transformers library. Although transformers will be covered in detail in a later module, this session aims to give you hands-on experience with loading and using a simple transformer model for a common NLP task. We will focus on text classification as our practical example.

**Objectives**

* Understand the basic concept of transformer models.
* Learn how to use the Hugging Face Transformers library to load and use a pre-trained transformer model.
* Perform a simple text classification task using a pre-trained model.

#### Session Breakdown

**Part 1: Brief Overview of Transformer Models**

**Key Points:**

1. **Introduction to Transformer Models**:
   * Transformer models were introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. in 2017.
   * Unlike traditional sequential models (e.g., RNNs, LSTMs), transformers can process input data all at once rather than one step at a time. This parallel processing makes transformers much faster and more efficient when working with large datasets.
2. **Architecture of Transformers**:
   * **Encoder-Decoder Structure**: The original transformer architecture consists of an encoder and a decoder, each composed of multiple layers of self-attention mechanisms and feed-forward neural networks.
   * **Self-Attention Mechanism**: This mechanism allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence when encoding a particular word, capturing dependencies regardless of distance in the text.
3. **Advantages of Transformers**:
   * **Parallelization**: The ability to process input sequences in parallel, leading to faster training times.
   * **Scalability**: Highly scalable and can be pre-trained on large datasets, then fine-tuned for specific tasks.
   * **Versatility**: Effective for a wide range of NLP tasks, including text classification, machine translation, and text generation.
4. **Popular Transformer Models**:
   * **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**: Designed for understanding the context of words in a text.
   * **GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)**: Focused on text generation.
   * **T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer)**: Treats all NLP tasks as a text-to-text problem.
   * **DistilBERT**: A smaller, faster, and cheaper version of BERT that retains most of its accuracy.
5. **Applications of Transformer Models**:
   * **Text Classification**: Categorizing text into predefined categories.
   * **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifying and classifying entities (e.g., names, dates) in text.
   * **Machine Translation**: Translating text from one language to another.
   * **Text Summarization**: Creating concise summaries of longer texts.
   * **Question Answering**: Answering questions based on input text.

#### Part 2: Practical Example using Hugging Face Transformers Library

**Steps:**

1.  **Install Necessary Libraries**:

    ```python
    !pip install transformers
    ```
2.  **Load a Pre-trained Transformer Model for Text Classification**:

    * We will use the `distilbert-base-uncased` model, which is a smaller, faster, and lighter version of BERT, fine-tuned for text classification.

    ```python
    from transformers import pipeline

    # Load a pre-trained text classification pipeline
    classifier = pipeline("sentiment-analysis", model="distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english")
    ```
3.  **Prepare Input Text**:

    * Let's create a sample text that we want to classify.

    ```python
    # Sample text
    text = "The Hugging Face Transformers library is fantastic for NLP tasks!"
    ```
4.  **Perform Text Classification**:

    * Use the loaded pipeline to classify the sentiment of the text.

    ```python
    # Perform classification
    result = classifier(text)

    # Print the result
    print(result)
    ```

#### Complete Example

Hereâ€™s the complete code to run in Google Colab:

```python
# Install Necessary Libraries
!pip install transformers

# Load a Pre-trained Transformer Model for Text Classification
from transformers import pipeline

# Load a pre-trained text classification pipeline
classifier = pipeline("sentiment-analysis", model="distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english")

# Prepare Input Text
text = "The Hugging Face Transformers library is fantastic for NLP tasks!"

# Perform Text Classification
result = classifier(text)

# Print the Result
print(result)
```

#### Explanation

1. **Install Necessary Libraries**:
   * We install the `transformers` library using `pip`.
2. **Load a Pre-trained Transformer Model for Text Classification**:
   * We use the `pipeline` function from the `transformers` library to load a pre-trained sentiment analysis model (`distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english`).
3. **Prepare Input Text**:
   * We create a sample text that we want to classify.
4. **Perform Text Classification**:
   * We use the classifier to predict the sentiment of the input text and print the result.

#### Summary

In this session, we provided a brief overview of transformer models and demonstrated how to use the Hugging Face Transformers library to perform a simple text classification task. This hands-on example serves as an introduction to working with transformers and sets the stage for more in-depth exploration in later modules.
